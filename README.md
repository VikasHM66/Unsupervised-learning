# Unsupervised-learning
Repository containing Unsupervised Learning Concepts, Case studies & mini projects Covered by me for academic purpose and self Learning. This Repository includes Unsupervised Learning concepts such as KMeans Clustering, Agglomerative clustering/Hierarchical clustering and after building the clustering models comparison of the models by building Various classification models and comparing the models by different model performance evaluation metrics.

# Contents.

   - ### Unsupervised Learning.
  
        - [Clustering-Rent The Runway dataset](https://github.com/VikasHM66/Unsupervised-learning/blob/main/Case%20study%20-%20Clustering%20-%20Rent%20The%20Runway..ipynb): The objective of this study is to segment the similar user and similar items in to clusters. Understanding the common charecteristic of each group will help the organization to promote their bussiness.
        
        - [Agglomerative Clustering - Red Wine quality dataset](https://github.com/VikasHM66/Unsupervised-learning/blob/main/Case%20study%2C%20Agglomerative%20Clustering.ipynb): The objective of this study is to Apply Data Cleaning to the Datasets and then apply Agglomerative clustering for find pattern and the best value for the following features.
        
        - [KMeans Clustering - Red Wine quality dataset](https://github.com/VikasHM66/Unsupervised-learning/blob/main/Case-study%2C%20K-Means%20Clustering..ipynb): The objective of this study is to Apply Data Cleaning to the Datasets and then apply Kmeans algorithm for find pattern and the best value of the K for the following features.
        
        - [KMeans Clustering - Abalone dataset](https://github.com/VikasHM66/Unsupervised-learning/blob/main/K-means%20Clustering.ipynb): The objective of this study is to select the number of clusters k that you think is the optimal number and built an KMeans clustering model and built classification model and evaluation of the model.

        - [Agglomerative Clustering - Grains dataset](https://github.com/VikasHM66/Unsupervised-learning/blob/main/Agglomerative%2CHierarchical%20Clustering.ipynb): Comparision of classes in target variable b/w Hierarchical clustering and K-Means clustering and building Classification models to test the accuracy.
 
        - [Principal Component Analysis - Iris dataset](https://github.com/VikasHM66/Unsupervised-learning/blob/main/Principal%20Component%20Analysis%20-%20PCA.ipynb): The objective of this study is reduce the unwanted non-contributing dimensions in the dataset by application of PCA and using the new dimensions of the PCA building classification models and evaluating the model performance.
